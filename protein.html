            <h2>What is Protein?</h2>
            <p>Protein is a macronutrient.</p>
            <p>We need macronutrients (sometimes called ‘macros’) as they provide us with energy. Other macronutrients include fats and carbohydrates.</p>
            <p>There are thousands of different proteins in the body that have a huge variety of roles, from supporting our immune function to keeping our muscles and bones healthy throughout life.</p>
            <p>Proteins are made up of chains of amino acids. When we digest protein from foods or drinks, it is broken down into amino acids. The body then builds all the different proteins it needs from these amino acids.</p>

            <h2>Key Facts about Protein</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Protein is a macronutrient (‘macros’).</li>
                <li>We need protein for energy and to help the body grow and repair itself.</li>
                <li>Amino acids are the building blocks of protein. When we digest proteins, they are broken down to amino acids, which the body uses to make new proteins.</li>
                <li>In the UK, on average, we are eating enough protein in our diets.</li>
                <li>It is a good idea to get protein from a variety of foods and the government recommends we eat more pulses that are naturally low in fat and high in fibre.</li>
