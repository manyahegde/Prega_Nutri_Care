            <h2>What are Vitamins and Minerals?</h2>
            <p>Vitamins and minerals are essential nutrients known as micronutrients. They are needed in smaller amounts in our diet compared to other nutrients like carbohydrates, protein, and fat. We can't produce vitamins and minerals in our body, so we must obtain them from our diet. While most vitamins and minerals come from our diet, exceptions include vitamin D, which we can produce in our skin when exposed to sunlight.</p>

            <h2>Key Facts about Vitamins and Minerals</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Vitamins and minerals have various functions in the body.</li>
                <li>A healthy and balanced diet should provide all necessary vitamins and minerals, except for vitamin D which mainly comes from sunlight exposure.</li>
                <li>Supplements may be recommended in certain cases, such as for children aged 6 months to 5 years who need a daily supplement containing vitamins A, C, and D.</li>
                <li>Vegetarian and vegan diets can provide most essential nutrients, although some nutrients like vitamin B12 may be challenging to obtain.</li>
