        <h2>What is Fat?</h2>
        <p>During pregnancy, fat is an important part of a balanced diet as it provides energy and helps in the development of your babyâ€™s brain and nervous system. It also helps your body absorb essential vitamins like A, D, E, and K.</p>
        <p>However, it's essential to consume healthy fats and avoid excessive saturated fats which can lead to health issues.</p>

        <h2>What Are the Different Types of Fat?</h2>
        <p>Fats in foods can either be saturated or unsaturated. Most foods that contain fat have a mixture of both saturated and unsaturated fats in different proportions. We normally describe a food as being high in saturated or unsaturated fat depending on which type they have more of.</p>
        <p>We need to be aware of the fat in our diet. For a healthy diet, it is important that most of the fats we eat are unsaturated.</p>
