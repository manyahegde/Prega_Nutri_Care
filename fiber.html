            <h2>What is Fibre?</h2>
            <p>Dietary fibre is a term used for carbohydrates found naturally in plants. It's not digested in the small intestine and reaches the large intestine intact. It is important to eat a variety of fibre-containing foods as it helps to keep our digestive system healthy and can prevent constipation. A high fibre diet may also reduce the risk of some diseases.</p>

            <h2>10 Top Tips To Increase Your Fibre Intake</h2>
            <p>Remember, if you need to increase your fibre intake, it’s a good idea to make these changes gradually to avoid bloating and gas. It’s also important to drink plenty of fluids (around 6-8 glasses per day for adults) and to be active for at least 150 minutes per week - as these both contribute to keeping your gut healthy.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Choose a high-fibre breakfast cereal - for example, wholegrain cereals like wholewheat biscuit cereal, no added sugar muesli, bran flakes or porridge.</li>
                <li>Add fibre to your cereal - try adding fresh fruit, dried fruit, seeds and/or nuts to your cereal or yogurt.</li>
                <li>Switch to wholemeal or seeded wholegrain breads - if you or your family usually only like white bread, start by trying the versions that combine white and wholemeal flours.</li>
                <li>Cook with wholegrains - like wholewheat pasta, bulgur wheat or brown rice.</li>
                <li>Leave the skin on potatoes - like baked potatoes, wedges or boiled new potatoes.</li>
                <li>Snack on fibre-rich foods - try opting for snacks like fruit, vegetable sticks, rye crackers, oatcakes, houmous and unsalted nuts.</li>
                <li>Include plenty of vegetables with meals - either as a side dish or added to sauces, stews or curries. This is a great way of getting children to eat more veg!</li>
                <li>Stoke up your freezer - keeping a handy supply of frozen vegetables in your freezer can prevent waste and ensure you’re never without.</li>
                <li>Add pulses to your favourite meals - pulses like beans, lentils or chickpeas can be easily added to stews, curries and salads.</li>
                <li>Don’t forget canned foods - canned beans or chickpeas are a quick and cost-effective way to add fibre to a meal.</li>
