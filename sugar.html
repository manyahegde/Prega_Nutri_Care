            <h2>What are Sugars?</h2>
            <p>Sugar is a simple carbohydrate found in various forms. Glucose and fructose join together to make sucrose, which is commonly known as 'sugar'. Sugars can be naturally occurring, like those in fruits and milk, or they can be added to different foods and drinks as 'free sugars'. Free sugars are those added to foods and drinks and also those found naturally in fruit juices, purees, honey, and syrups.</p>
