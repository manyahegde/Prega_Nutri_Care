            <h2>What are starchy foods?</h2>
            <p>Starchy foods are foods that are rich in starch, which is a type of carbohydrate. They are sometimes called ‘carbs’.</p>
            <p>When we eat starchy foods, our digestive system breaks down the starch into glucose which our body uses for energy.</p>
            <h3>Key facts about starchy foods</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Starch is a type of carbohydrate.</li>
                <li>Starchy foods are sometimes called ‘carbs’.</li>
                <li>Starchy foods are an important source of fibre as well as vitamins and minerals.</li>
                <li>Starchy foods are not fattening if you eat the right portion sizes. It’s important you do not eat more calories than you need from any food group.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Types of starchy foods include bread, pasta, and rice - it’s healthiest to choose wholegrain versions of these.</p>
            <p>If you have diabetes, this system doesn't work as effectively. For more nutritional information on diabetes, read our dedicated page.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Why do I need starchy foods in my diet?</h2>
            <p>In the UK, starchy foods are one of the main food groups in the Eatwell Guide. It’s recommended that starchy foods should make up about a third of the foods we eat.</p>
            <p>Starchy foods are an important source of fibre as well as vitamins and minerals, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>B vitamins – for example vitamin B1, which helps the body use the energy from the carbohydrates we eat and well as supporting the heart and nervous system</li>
                <li>Iron – important for normal brain function, the immune system and for the red blood cells that transport oxygen around the body</li>
                <li>Calcium – to help keep bones and teeth healthy</li>
                <li>Folate – needed to make healthy red blood cells and for the nervous system</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In the starchy foods group, wholegrains are a key source of fibre. Studies have found that fibre from wholegrains seems to be important for health, linked with reduced risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, bowel cancer and inflammation.</p>
            <p>Fibre from wholegrains is also important as it can provide food for ‘good bacteria’ in the gut. Find out more by reading our page on fibre.</p>
            <p><strong>‘White carbs’:</strong> More refined types of starchy food such as white bread, pasta, rice and potato products do not have to be excluded from your diet but there is some evidence that they are less good for our health.</p>
            <p>It’s a good idea to swap ‘white’ versions of starchy foods like bread, pasta or rice for wholegrains versions to improve the quality of carbohydrates we eat.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>How much starchy food should I have in my diet?</h2>
            <p>Although there are no government guidelines on portion sizes, we have provided information on portion sizes to help you get the right balance of foods for a healthy diet.</p>
            <p>From this recommendation, to get the right balance of foods for a healthy diet, we could eat about 3-4 portions of starchy foods a day.</p>
            <p>Some examples of portion sizes for adults for different starchy foods are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Two handfuls of dried pasta shapes or rice (75g)</li>
                <li>A bunch of spaghetti the size of a £1 coin, measured using your finger and thumb (75g)</li>
                <li>The amount of cooked pasta or rice that would fit in two hands cupped together (180g)</li>
                <li>A baked potato about the size of your fist (220g)</li>
                <li>About three handfuls of breakfast cereal (40g)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For snacks, suggested portion sizes are two oatcakes or about three handfuls of plain popcorn.</p>
